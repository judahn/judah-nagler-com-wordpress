	<h1>Please update your browser</h1>
	
	<p>While aware that some users still prefer to use older browsers such as Internet Explorer 8 &amp; below, it is outside the scope of this site to support them. This is solely due to preference and the internal belief that the experience of visiting or developing for the internet should be a pleasant and relatively consistent one.</p>

	<p>As a developer, I am happy to build sites and applications that support older browsers (and do so frequently), but for the purposes of this project, IE8 and below are not supported.</p>
